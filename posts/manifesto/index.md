When mentoring other developers and managers, I get asked a lot what process I go through when I am picking my battles. To be honest, the one consistent thing I look to is my manifesto. [Defined](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto) as "a written statement declaring publicly the intentions, motives, or views of its issuer," a manifesto is a powerful way to communicate your values and beliefs. While I have a personal manifesto for my everyday life, I have this easily accessible where I do my work.

# A Manifesto of a Manager

> Leadership is not management.
> Talent is not infinite.
> Optimize for people; the work will follow.
> Success is the success of others.
> Create opportunities.
> Act with the highest integrity.
> Remember you once wrote more than emails.

# A Programmer's Manifesto

> Act ethically in & out of code.
> Your comments are missives to both your future self and to others.
> Think globally, code locally.
> Quality begins with the API. Quality ends with the experience.
> Always value the work of others.
> Testing tests the problems we knnow we know.
> Do not miss opportunities to learn.
> The existential nature of all code is to solve a problem.
