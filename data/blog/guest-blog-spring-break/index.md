  - 2020-02-23: In modernizing this article from the archives of the internet, I realized that anyone who wants to can now make a website, a blog, or establish a digital presence. It was obviously different back in '04, when "Guest Blogs" meant you handed someone else your login and they wrote some interesting thoughts while you were away.
  - 2020-02-23: This was rescued from the archives of the old [felocity.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20040317150827/http://www.felocity.org/) site. Writing on the internet was pretty different back then.

It's time for guest stories!

For your amusement, things I saw today that i'm sure people are going to hell for:

1. Jesus Action Figure, complete with posable arms and real gliding action! (yes, that's what it says on the box).
2. Moses as well, with posable arms and shepard's crook.
3. Felt Mary and Buddha figurines, in magenta, of all colors. I'll let you imagine it. These were probably the freakiest looking of the bunch stated here.
4. As if illustrations weren't enough, there is now a popup Kama Sutra, for those of you who need more assistance.
5. Pope-on-a-rope. Enough said.

More products will be posted as they are found.
