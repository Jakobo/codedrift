It’s no secret that [tech lacks diversity](https://gigaom.com/2014/08/21/eight-charts-that-put-tech-companies-diversity-stats-into-perspective/). For most companies, less than 20% of individuals in technical roles identify as female. Less than 20% identify as [non-white, non-asian](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/opinion/sunday/silicon-valleys-diversity-problem.html?_r=0). These are just reported categories. It should be obvious. We, Silicon Valley, have a diversity problem.

A small Cal State fifty miles south of San Jose is doing something about it. As of 2018

- CSUMB accounts for 5.8% of all CS graduates in the CSU system (23 schools)
- But represents 9% of all graduates in the CSU system identifying as female
- And represents 7.6% of all graduates in the CSU system identifying from a Latinx background

The School of Computing & Design at CSUMB is reshaping the conversation. Established through alumni donations in early 2015, the SCD Diversity Fund represents a two part plan to create a more diverse and inclusive industry.

- To encourage opportunity for students currently enrolled at CSUMB, the **Diversity Conference Program** will send individuals in good academic standing to diversity focused events in technology including Grace Hopper, Self.Conference, and Out For Undergrad.
- Giving back to the communities that surround the university, the **Technology Ambassador Program** encourages current students and CSUMB alumni to return to their schools within the Monterey/Salinas area and inspire the next generation of students to overcome the challenges of the Digital Divide.

This is a program I am excited to have a hand in both founding and funding.

## Get Involved

The SCD Diversity Fund is ambitious. While funded through the CSUMB alumni working in Silicon Valley, the program can only reach a fraction of the university’s students. To grow the effort, we are calling upon the alumni, community, and people who believe in the Vision of CSUMB to continue to develop the fund. 100% of the donations are allocated towards the university’s commitment to diversity in technology.

### Fund Details

The SCD Diversity Fund is allocated in the following manner:

- 65% of contributions go towards the Diversity Conference Program
- 20% of contributions go towards the Technology Ambassador Program
- 15% of contributions enable the School of Communication & Design to pursue additional diversity efforts outside of the above two programs

You can find [CSUMB's enrollment fact sheet](https://csumb.edu/iar/enrollment-fast-facts-most-recent-term) online. Since this original announcement CSUMB has continued to develop the SCD Diversity Fund to create additional opportunities for their students of all backgrounds.
