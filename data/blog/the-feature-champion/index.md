That was the new buzzword today, courtesy of management. Those responsible for being the first point of contact in uPortal and are to be the knowledge experts on their section are now called "Feature Champions". It sounds so strange several of us could hardly contain a giggle every time the term was used.

I'll tell you what, let's have a "Feature Crusade" where we put down the "Feature Creatins" and restore "Feature Justice" to the "Feature World". After the "Feature Feast" we will make a "Feature Feature Film" and try and garnish a "Feature Oscar".

That's some feature.

In other news, I was just presented with a certificate for my hard work and appreciation. Apparently everyone on the HSDL staff got one, which seems to have lessened its value. However, it is blue and it is shiny. It is also signed by someone whose name I don't recognise.
