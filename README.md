# Stack

- Site is a [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app, deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
  - It leverages `getStaticProps` where possible, falling back to `getInitialProps` where there's large amounts of data access
  - A [GraphQL Proxy](https://github.com/jakobo/codedrift/blob/main/src/pages/api/proxy/api.github.com/graphql.ts) connects to GitHub which doubles as a CMS
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for the styling
- There's eslint, commitlint, and conventional commit running via Husky, because I'd rather be annoyed on `git-commit` than several months later
- It's in Typescript, because I want to get better at typing things

# Developing

1. `yarn dev`

# og:image generation

I use Windows + WSL2. It has its upsides. These would be a downside. There is no _good_ way to get a functional pupeteer instance inside of WSL. You can run an installed chrome version with a whole lotta flags. It works. Here be dragons. üêâ

# Outstanding Issues

This is a rough list of things I'd like to do

- [ ] Expose post revision data (`changelog` in frontmatter)
- [ ] Go digging for old posts from LinkedIn/Medium/Felocity.org
- [ ] Explore bringing github comments into the webmentions area on individual posts

You could file bugs. They'll be triaged. I file bugs against myself, if only so I remember something's broken.
