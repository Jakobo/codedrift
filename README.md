# The Neverending List of TODOs

By listing these here, I'm accepting that this site is not only a work in progress, but that these items shouldn't prevent me from putting myself out into the world.

- [ ] Track active tab w/ underline or bold in header
- [ ] Change to Tailwind, away from styled-system. Keep the vertical rythym!
- [ ] Permalinks in an obvious place
- [ ] Scale down About heading
- [ ] New section: Speaking or Projects. Links to talks, podcasts, and slides. Maybe replace Aibex link
- [ ] Dark mode footer shouldn't invert
