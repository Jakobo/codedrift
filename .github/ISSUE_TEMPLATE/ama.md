<!--
I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

Guidelines
1. Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
2. Use a succinct title and description.
3. Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
4. port questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
5. civil and polite.
